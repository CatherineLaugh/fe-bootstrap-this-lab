# Bootstrap THIS!

In this lab, you'll be taking plain old vanilla HTML and adding Bootstrap classes to spruce up a weather website and make it look shnazzy.

## Instructions

Fork and clone this lab, and open it up in your text editor. Open the `index.html` file - this is where you'll be doing the majority of your work.

## Step 1: Connect to Bootstrap

The first thing we need to do is connect to the Bootstrap Stylesheet in the `<head>` of our HTML page. Here's a link to the Bootstrap CDN in case you need it:

[https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css](https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.7/css/bootstrap.css">)

## Step 2: Apply Bootstrap to existing Elements

In index.html, look at the comments and apply the Bootstrap classes to make the Weather World page look more professional:

## Step 3: Add Additional Elements

At the bottom of the index.html page, there are a few additional challenges to take on. Good luck!

## Step 4: Add Custom Styling

In `style.css`, add additional styling to make the Weather World page look even more awesome. Fonts, color schemes, backgrounds, etc - the sky is the limit (pun intended)!
